# CS 225 Fall 2022 Final Project
This project explores the most efficient (shortest) path through the utilization of BFS, Dijkstra’s algorithm, and A* Search. The goal of this project is to gain insight into how people can travel between airports with the shortest route possible. The OpenFlights dataset used in this project can be found at https://openflights.org/data.html.
