# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will meet face to face three times a week at least one hour each time. Time and place for each group meeting will be agreed on Discord beforehand. We will be fully respectful to every group member and listen to every word no matter concerns, ideas, or suggestions. Haozhe will record time for each meeting.

2. **Assistance** 
We will create a group chat on Discord, every member can post their question on the group chat. Besides, we also have each other's phone number. We will respond to our teammates as soon as possible.

3. **Respect** 
In order to ensure that everyone in the team can share their ideas, we will have a discussion before each meeting to let everyone explain their ideas about the project.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will have a team meeting to discuss the work distribution after the assignment is released. Every member will get the same amount of work. If someone has problems in their portion, other members are responsible to help him. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
We plan to spend 10 hours on the project. When one or more team members have a time conflict, we will discuss a compromise time of the meeting in advance, but we will still make sure to spend at least 10 hours on the project each week.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
All the group members are respectful and friendly to each other. If a conflict happens, other members in the group are responsible to put out the fire diplomatically. If that does not help, we will ask the team mentor Mr. Gomber for help. If one or more members do not contribute to the project or are not communicating with team members in a positive manner, other members are responsible to point out and help them out. If one or more members are habitually late, we will first remind him or them and help him or them make a time plan, and if that doesn't work, we will consider kicking him off the team.
